This dish was a perfect example of how traditional recipes can be elevated with local, indigenous ingredients, creating something both familiar and new.\n","</p>\n","<p>\n","In search of a true Australian pub experience, I headed to <span style=\"color:green; font-weight:bold;\">The Lord Nelson Brewery Hotel</span> in <span style=\"color:pink; font-weight:bold;\">The Rocks</span>. This historic pub serves up hearty, classic Australian fare, and the \"Roast Lamb\" was exactly what I was craving. The lamb, roasted to tender perfection, was served with a medley of root vegetables and a rich gravy, making for a comforting and satisfying meal. Paired with one of their house-brewed ales, it was a quintessential Aussie pub experience that I would highly recommend.\n","</p>\n","<p>\n","I couldn't miss out on trying some of the famous Australian barbecue, so I headed to <span style=\"color:green; font-weight:bold;\">Vic's Meat Market</span> at the <span style=\"color:pink; font-weight:bold;\">Sydney Fish Market</span>. The \"BBQ Beef Brisket\" was a highlight, slow-cooked to achieve a melt-in-the-mouth texture, and served with a tangy barbecue sauce. The smoky, rich flavor of the brisket was enhanced by the vibrant, outdoor setting of the market, where the aroma of grilling meat filled the air.\n","</p>\n","<p>\n","To round off my exploration of local cuisine, I visited <span style=\"color:green; font-weight:bold;\">Bennelong</span>, located within the iconic <span style=\"color:pink; font-weight:bold;\">Sydney Opera House</span>. This fine dining restaurant celebrates Australian produce in every dish. The \"Sydney Rock Oysters\" were an exquisite start to the meal, served with a delicate vinaigrette that highlighted their briny freshness. The oysters, sourced from local waters, were plump and succulent, offering a pure taste of the sea.\n","</p>\n","```"],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"}],"source":["journal_sydney = read_journal(\"sydney.txt\")\n","\n","# Modify the prompt below\n","prompt = f\"\"\"\n","Given the following journal entry, identify all **restaurant names** and **neighborhoods**.\n","\n","**Style Requirement:**\n","* Highlight and bold all **restaurant names** in **green**.\n","* Highlight and bold all **neighborhoods** (or general location names) in **pink**.\n","\n","**Output Format:**\n","Provide the complete, styled text as **HTML** suitable for display in a Jupyter notebook.
